\chapter{Data: Tables and Maps}
All data, including maps, shall be organized in tables. Each table has to contain at least a single key (column of the table). Division between keys and values are defined by "role" column in a corresponding table header definition. Each key has to be unique in a table.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Frozen Tables (FT)}
\textbf{Frozen Tables} are tables which are defined for a specific simulator version. They have fixed size and constant keys defined by this document. The column configuration is also constant or depends on other constant or static tables. Selected values can be set only before simulating. During the simulation, they are always read only.

\section{Constant Maps (CM)}
\textbf{Constant Maps} are tables which are defined for a specific model with the geographical context. Their sizes, column configuration, and content have to be set before simulating. During the simulation, their are always read only.
